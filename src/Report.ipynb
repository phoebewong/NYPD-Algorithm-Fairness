    "## Fairness and Interpretability Metrics\n",
    "We explore a few commonly used metrics to evaluate the fairness of our model prediction and the local interpretability of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical parity\n",
    "Statistical parity measures the difference between the probability of positive decisions for the protected group and the probability of positive decisions for the unprotected group. Mathematically:\n",
    "$$Sp = P(d=1|G=0) - P(d=1|G=1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, $Sp$ should be small such that there is little difference of probability of positive decisionb etween protected and unprotected group. A large value of $Sp$ suggests potential unfairness in the dataset and $Sp$ of 0 suggests complete fairness (equal probability between classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our dataset, we can examine the probability of positive decision (stopped and arrested) between different **gender** and **race**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of gender, we are comparing the proportion of positive decisions amongst male and substracting the proportion of positive decisions amongst female\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Sp = \\frac{ \\text{# positive predictions and male}} { \\text{ # of male} } - \\frac{ \\text{# positive predictions and female}} { \\text{ # of female}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Parity\n",
    "Besides Statistical parity, we can further evaluate if there is any difference between classes if we condition the classes on a certain condition, in other words, are we being fair, in terms of statistical parity, in that subgroup? For example, in our dataset, we can consider `race` column as our condition, and evaluate the difference between the two genders when conditioned on race. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{ \\text{# positive predictions and black male}} { \\text{ # of black male} } - \\frac{ \\text{# positive predictions and black female}} { \\text{ # of black female}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### False Positive (Negative) Error Rate Balance (FPR/FNR)\n",
    "The two parity measures do not take into account the real labels of each observation; they only consider the predictions. False Positive/Negative Error Rate Balance examines if there are equal poportions of false positives/false negatives in protected and unprotected classes. This is a particularly important metric in cases where committing mistakes disproportionately for different protected groups can bring negative outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of using gender as the protected class, the definitions are as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$FPR = \\frac{ \\text{# false positive in male}} { \\text{ # of male} } - \\frac{ \\text{# false positive in female}} { \\text{ # of female}}$\n",

    "$FPR = \\frac{ \\text{# false negative in male}} { \\text{ # of male} } - \\frac{ \\text{# false negative in female}} { \\text{ # of female}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "while false positive is defined as count of cases where the true label is false and the predicted label is true, vice versa for false negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SHAP\n",
    "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Overall, SHAP connects game theory with local explanations, uniting several previous methods and representing the only possible consistent and locally accurate additive feature attribution method based on expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of SHAP value\n",
    "Mathematically, we can break down the calculation of SHAP value as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_x(S) = f(h_x(z')) = E[f(x) | x_S]$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $z'$ represent a feature being observed ($z_i'$ = 1) or unknown ($z_i'$ = 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $h_x$ is a mapping that maps between a binary pattern of missing features represented by $z'$ and the original function input space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such mapping, we can evaluate $f(h_x(z'))$ and so calculate the effect of observing ($z_i' = 1$) or not observing a feature ($z_i' = 0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $S$ refers the set of non-zero indexes in $z'$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $E[f(x) | x_S]$ is the expected value of the function conditioned on a subset $S$ of the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SHAP values combine these conditional expectations with the classic Shapley values from game theory to attribute $\\phi_i$ values to each feature:\n",
